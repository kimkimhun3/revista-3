## A Winter Ski Adventure at Ryuoo Ski Park

On **January 27, 2024**, I went on a ski trip to **Ryuoo Ski Park** in Nagano with my friend. It was a **one-day trip**, meaning we left in the morning and returned in the evening. We took a **highway bus** from **Tokyo** (Shinjuku station) to **Ryuoo**, and we had booked everything in advance—a week before the trip. This included our **ski clothes, snowboard, and bus tickets**.


## Arriving at Ryuoo Ski Park

We left Tokyo at around 11 PM, and after a long bus ride, we finally arrived at Ryuoo Ski Park around 6 AM. The first thing we did was pick up our pre-booked snowboard, gloves, clothes, hat, and glasses. Once we got changed and ready, we grabbed some breakfast and took a 30-minute rest before heading to the slopes to start skiing.

However, when we got to the ski rentals, we encountered a problem. The ski park only accepted cash and did not take credit cards, which was an issue because we didn’t have enough cash on hand. My Japanese was limited, but I decided to ask a kind Japanese man if he could help us exchange some money. We explained our situation, and he offered to help us. He suggested we transfer the amount via LINE Pay, and he would give us the cash in return. It was a bit of a stressful situation, but this gentleman’s kindness really saved us. We were finally able to get the cash and continue with our plans.
## A Challenge with Skiing for the First Time

It was my **first time skiing**, and I had no experience. I wasn’t very good at snowboarding, and I fell down many times. Watching other skiers glide effortlessly made me feel a little nervous, but I was determined to keep going. The park was set on the mountain, with many **different ski slopes** to choose from. It took me a while to get used to snowboarding, but even though it was tough, I really enjoyed the challenge and the thrill of the experience.


## A Cold Afternoon and a Strange Drink Choice

In the afternoon, we went to the top of the mountain to enjoy some food. The temperature was around **-3°C**, which made the whole experience feel even more wintery. Despite the cold, I ordered my usual **iced latte**—yes, even at **-3°C**. I got some strange looks from the other skiers, but it was worth it for me!

We also had **curry** for the first time in Japan, even though I wasn’t a big fan of curry. My friend recommended it, so I gave it a try—and I was surprised! It turned out to be delicious, and it was the perfect way to warm up in the freezing temperatures.

At this place, we also ran into the **man who helped us with the cash exchange issue** earlier. We had a nice chat with him, and it felt great to thank him in person for his kindness. It made the whole experience even more memorable.


## Skiing in the Snow and Meeting Other Skilled Skiers

After lunch, we went to a special area reserved for **advanced skiers**. It was impressive to watch people navigate those slopes with such skill. Everyone looked really good at it! We were amazed by their ability to master the difficult routes.

On our way back down, it was still very cold, but the snow was falling gently, and it felt magical to ski through the snowflakes. The whole atmosphere of being on the mountain surrounded by nature was something I’ll never forget.

## A Surprise Encounter

At around **4 PM**, we headed to the bus station to begin our journey back to **Tokyo**. But something surprising happened during the highway bus ride. When the bus made a stop at another station, I accidentally ran into some friends who had gone skiing to a different location in **Nagano**—they were in **Hakuba**, while I was at Ryuoo! It was an amazing coincidence. We chatted for a bit and decided to have some **chicken** together before continuing our separate ways.


## Returning to Tokyo

Finally, we arrived in **Tokyo** around **9 PM**, and to top off the day, we had some **ramen** in Tokyo. It was a great way to end a day full of skiing, snow, and good memories.

## A Memorable Experience

This trip to **Ryuoo Ski Park** was my first time skiing, and it was an experience I will always cherish. From the challenge of snowboarding to the beautiful winter views and the kindness of strangers, it made for a day filled with excitement and new experiences.
