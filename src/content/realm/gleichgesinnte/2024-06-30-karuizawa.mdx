## A Day Trip to Karuizawa  
On June 30, 2024, I went on a one-day trip to Karuizawa with a friend. We left early in the morning from Saitama, taking the Shinkansen to Karuizawa, which only took about an hour.

## Arriving in Karuizawa  
We arrived around 8 AM. The weather was a bit rainy, but it didn’t dampen our spirits. Our first stop was a local coffee shop to warm up and rest for a bit.

## Exploring Karuizawa Prince Plaza  
After our quick break, we headed to Karuizawa Prince Plaza, a large shopping mall. It was packed, probably because it was a Sunday. The mall featured luxury brands like Nike, Adidas, LV, and Gucci. I bought some Nike shorts and a t-shirt, while my friend picked up a new pair of Nike shoes and a Lego set.

## Lunch and More Shopping  
For lunch, we ate ramen, which was delicious and perfect for the cool, rainy day.

## Museum of Contemporary Art  
In the afternoon, we visited the Museum of Contemporary Art in Karuizawa. It’s a short five-minute drive from the station and specializes in works by world-renowned Japanese artists. There were many interesting and thought-provoking exhibits.

## Kyu-Karuizawa Ginza Shopping Street  
After the museum, we went to Kyu-Karuizawa Ginza, a charming shopping street that runs along the old Nakasendo route. It was a lovely area with local shops selling fresh fruit, jams, souvenirs, and more. We picked up some coffee and souvenirs while enjoying the clean, old-fashioned atmosphere. The town has a pleasant, relaxed vibe with chic cafes and restaurants.

## Heading Home  
At around 3 PM, we decided to head back to Karuizawa Station and took the Shinkansen back to Saitama. It was a great day trip—short, but full of wonderful experiences.
