# A New Chapter: My Journey as a Software Developer in Japan

In the spring of 2023, a new chapter began as I left my homeland, driven by an insatiable curiosity to explore beyond the familiar. After an 8-hour flight, I touched down in Tokyo, Japan — a land distinct from my humid Cambodian roots. The weather greeted me first, a refreshing departure from what I knew, almost like stepping into a long-cherished dream.

Fast forward over 4 months, and here I am, a software developer in Japan. The journey has been rife with challenges, yet equally rewarding in witnessing my evolution into a proficient developer. But let’s talk candidly — it’s been an emotional roller coaster. I had imagined a life of pure joy beyond the 9-to-5 grind, yet reality had its own plans. Join me as I share my experiences as a software developer immersed in the heart of Japan.

## Life Beyond Borders

What could be more exhilarating than landing a job abroad fresh out of graduation? Yet, the excitement dimmed as I realized leaving my comfort zone was essential for personal growth. As a non-Japanese speaker, daily life presented its challenges, but the country’s advanced technology and warm hospitality have been invaluable allies. The current weather is a delight, though unexpected surprises are always possible, like the recent earthquake I experienced. Despite the hurdles, Tokyo offers an abundance of places to explore. Even in solitude, there’s solace in absorbing the surroundings.

The food culture stands out — a mosaic of traditions woven into modern living. Every eatery unveils a distinct cultural blend, perpetually fascinating me.

## Here’s Come the Challenge

I am working in a so-called tech startup where each person is really important for their role and responsibility. We are a small team but what we’re doing is quite big. I’ve been exposed to different projects and I need to push myself way above my limit otherwise I wouldn’t survive in this working environment. I have to be really flexible and reaching out every time. I could see there’s a very big barrier between the language we’re using and it leads to misunderstanding the purpose in the working objective. Well, guess what? I am getting burn-out after two months and it is tough.

## What Do I Learn and How Do I Overcome the Challenge

First thing first, I have no intention to offend anyone in any form. Everyone is great in their own way. I’ve learned that pushing myself to work so hard is somehow a good thing. I’ve learned a lot for the past months. On the other hand, as much as I learn there’s also a time where I break down as well. So what I think is to not push yourself too hard and break down later. Instead, be consistent.



My role as a software developer in a foreign land has tested my mettle and unveiled a tapestry of emotions. The path to proficiency has been punctuated with challenges, but these hurdles have only propelled my growth. Amidst the hurdles of language barriers and the demands of a startup, I’ve come to realize the delicate balance between pushing oneself and preventing burnout. Tokyo, with its blend of modernity and tradition, has taught me the importance of consistency over the intensity of effort.

As I look back at my journey, I’m reminded that life is a collection of moments woven together by resilience, adaptability, and the pursuit of self-improvement. Every experience, whether joyful or challenging, contributes to our evolution. And as I continue to navigate life abroad and in the tech startup realm, I carry forward the lessons of embracing change, learning from obstacles, and fostering an unwavering spirit.
