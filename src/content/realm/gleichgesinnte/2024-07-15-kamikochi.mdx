# Last Summer's Solo Adventure to Kamikochi

In July 2024, I set off on an unforgettable solo trip to Kamikochi, nestled in the heart of the Japanese Alps. The journey itself was a memorable part of the adventure, starting early in the morning with a ride on the Shinkansen from my home, Saitama, to Nagano Station. This was my third time visiting Nagano, following my ski trips to **Ryuoo** and **Karuizawa**.
## Morning Journey on the Shinkansen  
At around 7:00 AM, I boarded the Shinkansen, feeling both excited and a little nervous to be traveling alone. Watching the scenic countryside pass by, the quick ride set a perfect pace to kickstart my trip. By around 8:30 AM, I arrived in Nagano, ready for the next leg of the journey.

## Highway Bus to Kamikochi  
From Nagano Station, I hopped on a highway bus bound for Kamikochi. The bus departed around 9:00 AM, winding through beautiful mountain landscapes and passing quaint towns. It felt as though I was leaving behind the bustling world and stepping into nature’s sanctuary. After several hours on the road, with a couple of brief rest stops along the way, I reached Kamikochi around 1:00 PM, just in time to experience the breathtaking afternoon views.

## Arriving in Kamikochi  
As soon as I arrived in Kamikochi, I felt completely surrounded by nature. The fresh mountain air was refreshing, and I could immediately feel the coolness of summer in the Japanese Alps. The afternoon sun lit up the landscape, and I could see the clear blue waters of the Azusa River running through the valley. Tall, lush green trees lined the riverbanks, with the peaks of the Hotaka mountains towering in the background.

## Hiking Along the Azusa River  
After taking in the initial views, I started walking along the trail that follows the Azusa River. The path stretched for about 10 kilometers, offering incredible views the entire way. The river sparkled under the sunlight, and I could see reflections of the mountains and trees in the water. Every turn along the trail seemed to open up to new scenery, each spot more beautiful than the last.

Along the way, I noticed signs reminding hikers about bears in the area, as well as the presence of crows. It added a bit of adventure to the hike, as it was a reminder to stay alert and keep my bell handy—a common practice for hikers in Japan to ward off bears. Although it added a sense of caution, it didn’t take away from the experience. If anything, it made the walk even more memorable and exciting.

## Friendly Encounters and Amazing Views  
One of the best parts of the hike was meeting so many friendly people along the trail. Every hiker I passed greeted me with a cheerful “Hello” or “Konnichiwa,” making the whole experience feel warm and welcoming. This simple friendliness added to the beauty of the journey and made it feel special.

Finally, after hours of hiking, I was tired but happy. The views had been worth every step. As a souvenir, I bought a few beers with unique hiking designs to bring home.

## Wrapping Up the Journey  
With my adventure in Kamikochi coming to an end, I took a bus back to Nagano and then boarded the Shinkansen back to Saitama. Before leaving, I bought some local beer and a few souvenirs to remember the trip. It was the perfect finish to an incredible solo adventure, leaving me with memories I’d cherish.
