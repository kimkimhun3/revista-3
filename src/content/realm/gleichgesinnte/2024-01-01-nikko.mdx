## A Winter Journey Begins
On January 1st, 2024, I went on a 3-day winter trip to Nikko, Tochigi, with my friend and my senior. We took a train from Asakusa Station in Tokyo to Nikko using a Japan Rail Pass, which made the trip smooth and easy. The train ride, with its beautiful views, took about 2.5 hours. After arriving at Nikko Station, we took a bus to our hotel. By the time we checked in and settled into our room, it was already mid-afternoon.

## Exploring Nikko's Beauty
After checking in, we went out to explore. Nikko is famous for its natural beauty, and we visited stunning places like calm lakes, waterfalls, temples, and shrines.

We started with Shinkyo Bridge, a sacred red bridge marking the entrance to Nikko's World Heritage sites. It’s not only beautiful but also culturally important as it symbolizes the gateway to Nikko’s historical and spiritual landmarks.

Next, we visited Kegon Falls, one of Japan’s most famous waterfalls, located in Nikko National Park. The 97-meter waterfall looked amazing, especially with the surrounding snow, creating a breathtaking view.

After that, we went to Lake Chuzenji, the highest-altitude lake in Japan, situated in Nikko National Park. The peaceful lake, surrounded by snow-covered mountains, gave us a stunning and serene view.

The highlight of the trip was seeing snow for the first time. Although I grew up in Japan, I had never seen snow before, and experiencing the snowy landscape was magical.

## A Snowy Mountain Tour
On the second day, we joined a local bus tour through the mountains. The bus went along winding roads lined with tall trees covered in snow, creating a dreamy and peaceful atmosphere. Along the way, we saw some monkeys playing in the snow, which made the trip even more enjoyable.

My First Onsen Experience
Later that day, we returned to our guest house. It was a shared room where everyone had their own bed. It was different from staying in a hotel, but it was warm and comfortable.

I decided to try the onsen (hot spring) for the first time. At first, I was nervous, but the warm water was so relaxing that I quickly got used to it. By the end, I absolutely loved it! That evening, we spent time playing board games and having drinks in the guest house lounge, which was a fun way to end the day.

## A Late-Night BBQ Adventure
On our last night, we explored more local spots, enjoyed delicious food, and bought some souvenirs to remember the trip. We also took photos and a video to capture the snowy scenery and our fun moments.

Around 10 or 12 at night, we realized most restaurants were closed. Just as we were about to call it a night, we found a small Korean restaurant run by an elderly couple. The cozy restaurant felt so warm in the freezing cold. We enjoyed a delicious BBQ meal, had a few drinks, and even received a thoughtful souvenir from the kind owners before heading back to the guest house.

## A Relaxing End to the Trip
Before we left, I tried the onsen one last time. This time, I felt completely comfortable and fully enjoyed the experience. Afterward, we packed up and reflected on how special the trip had been. The snow, the hot springs, the food, and the time spent together made it an unforgettable winter getaway.

## Final Thoughts
This trip will always be a wonderful memory for me, especially because it was my first time seeing snow and trying an onsen. It was a perfect winter adventure, and I’m already looking forward to my next trip!
