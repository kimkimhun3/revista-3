# A Winter Adventure at GALA Yuzawa

On February 23, my friend and I set off on our second ski adventure, this time to GALA Yuzawa in Niigata, Japan. After our first ski trip to Ryuoo Ski Park, we were excited to hit the slopes again and enjoy the snowy mountains.

## Journey to Yuzawa

We began our trip by taking the JR Line from Takasaki Station to Yuzawa Station, a scenic two-hour journey. The experience of traveling through a dark tunnel only to emerge into a snow-covered wonderland was magical—like crossing into a new world filled with fresh snow blanketing the trees and landscape.

## Arriving and Preparing for Skiing

Once we arrived at GALA Yuzawa, we picked up all our reserved gear: ski clothes, snowboard, goggles, and lift tickets. We skipped breakfast at the station since we had already eaten on the train. After gearing up, we were ready to hit the slopes.

## Heading Up the Mountain

GALA Yuzawa has a unique setup with the main ski area high up on the mountain. We took a 15-minute ropeway ride to reach it, surrounded by a breathtaking, snowy landscape. It was a thrilling experience but extremely cold—yet it added to the excitement of the day.

## Improving My Skiing Skills

This was my second time snowboarding, and I felt more confident with my technique. Despite the cold and the falling snow, we managed to ski further up the mountain with each lift ride, surrounded by a crowd of skilled skiers.

## Skiing Until the Last Moment

After lunch, we continued skiing, making the most of our time on the slopes. The snow kept falling, making it even more beautiful as we rode the lifts higher and higher.

## Heading Home

By 3 PM, we were tired and decided to make our way down the mountain. We took the ropeway back to the base and headed to the Shinkansen station, which was conveniently located inside the ski station lobby. The Shinkansen ride was incredibly fast—just 30 minutes—compared to the two-hour JR line ride to get there.

On the way back, I also bought a souvenir from Yuzawa for my co-worker as a memento of the trip.

## Reflections on a Winter Adventure

It was my second time skiing, and it was an amazing experience. The snow, the cold, the thrilling rides, and even the moments of surprise, like meeting the guy who helped us with the cash issue, made it an unforgettable winter adventure.
